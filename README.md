📈 Line Chart: A comprehensive trend of global internet usage from 1960 to 2023, highlighting the internet's transformative growth. <br>

Key takeaways: <b>
In 2023, we can see that the Internet coverage rate in Saudi Arabia is 100%, 99% in Norway and 99.69% in Malaysia. Note that we have missing data for the year 2023, notably for African countries, the USA and Canada. <br>
However, in 2022, in Africa, the Maghreb states (Morocco: 89.9%, Libya: 88.42%, Egypt: 72.19%, Algeria: 71.24%) and Southern Africa (South Africa: 74.90%, Botswana: 77.32%, Namibia: 62.21%) outperform the other countries in terms of Internet access rates. In the same year (2022), in West Africa only Senegal (59.98%) and Ghana (69.84%) will be spending the 50% bar in Internet access rates. <br>
Back to 2000, according to WorldBank only Canada (52%) and Norway (51,3%) surpassed the 50% mark in terms of Internet access. 
Overall, the countries of South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa are struggling to ensure good Internet coverage for their populations. This is because most of these countries have low incomes.
